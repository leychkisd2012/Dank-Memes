    <h2>PvE in General</h2>
    <p>PvE stand for player versus environment and essentially requires tha player to fight and hopefully kill various computer generated foes at cosmic sites. These sites can vastly range in difficultyfrom some being really easy to some requiring multiple people in powerful ships to complete. That being said, PvE is a high-risk, high-reward way of making ISK and with enough good advice and location, can make a man very wealthy. To start, you won't want to bother with most pirate sites in High-Security because they are worth very little. You will have far more luck making money by compleeting sites in Low and Null(0.0)sec space, although if you plan on going to null-sec, consider joining a corporation that has a base so that you won't have to deal with other players wanting to kill you. Another issue is that many of the high-value sites require ships that can put out a ton of damage and take a lot as well, which can require a long time to train for and can also be expensive to fly the right ship. That being said, joining a corp early on can greatly help with this by providing you funding, assuming they are generous enough. You might also want to read a few wikipedia articles to learn more on the subject.</p>
    <p>In general, you won't want to make most of your money through PvE unless you have a strong, higher tier, ship and plenty of preperation and previous experience via corp buddies. If you can, consider putting together a group of people to fight high level sites to make it easier to beat, even if it means sharing some of the spoils.</p>
