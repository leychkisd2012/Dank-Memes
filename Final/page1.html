    <h2>Mining in General</h2>
    <p>For most players, mining will be the first and most reliable way for players to make a quick buck. The ship that everyone starts with after the tutorial is the most basic mining ship that you will find and for early players, it will be the way to generate a few million ISK in just a few hours if they are consistent. The gerat thign about mining is that its is normally pretty safe and doesn't require much attention to manage meaning that you can do other things while you mine in the background. Unfortunatly, it is by far and away the slowest way to make money in EVE except maybe trying to farm high-security pirate sites which are worth virtually nothing.  </p>
    <p>If you decide that mining is your calling, you will want to skill up for mining barges that can fit strip miners. These give you a much larger range and significantly higher mining efficiency, as well as a large ore hold so that you don't have to make as many drop-off trips to your storage station. If you want to keep going, get a tier two mining barge with tier 2 strip miners and really haul in the goods, but be warned, mining can get VERY boring.</p>
