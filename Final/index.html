    <h2>What is EvE?</h2>
    <p>EVE: Online is an mmorpg that takes place several thousand years into the future in a glaxay called New Eden. Apart from the vague backstory, EVE is a very versatile game in which any player can sit down and, with enough time and dedication, become a powerful pilot and member of the EVE community.That being said, EVE is also like a second job or life and in order to enjoy it, you need a basic rundown of what you are really getting into. The trailers can be missleading. </p>
    <p>If you watched either of the two trailers, you may have noticed the heavy emphasis on player versus player combat on large scales, when in reality, these types of battles rarely occur. Now one thing you need to understand is that this game is very old, being released in 2003 and although many things have changed since then, many of the most powerful players are veterans and have played since or not long after the games release. These players are the ones who control large Corporations and alliances, but I'll got a bit further into that later. What you need to know however, is that EVE is a game with relatively slow progression if you decide not to spend money on it. The two most important resources in this game are ISK which is the main currency, and Skill points, which you generate automtically, although rather slowly, and lets you use new modules or fits on ships. However, this guide will be more for learning how to generate ISK to buy early starter ships in order to boost your way right into the game while still having fun.</p>
